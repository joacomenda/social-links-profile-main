## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Media-Queries

### What I learned

I learned about Media Queries an how to adjust the webpage to larger screen sizes, I'm still learning but this was the best result so far.

I'm very proud of this pieces of code, is the first time I have mobile design in my mind since the start of the project.

```css
@media all and (min-width:320px)
{
    .container
    {
        max-width: 260px;
    }
}


@media all and (min-width:375px)
{
    .container
    {
        max-width: 280px;
    }
}

@media all and (min-width:500px)
{
    .container
    {
        max-width: 400px;
    }
}
```

### Continued development

I need to continue to learn about Media Queries, my mobile design need a lot of improvments

### Useful resources

- [Slaying The Dragon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K24lUqcT0Ms) - This helped me to understand how to use Media Queries and when to use them,
